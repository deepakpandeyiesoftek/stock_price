I encountered some challenges because my current account is on the basic plan.

As mentioned in the assignment text file, I need to retrieve the list of the top 20 stocks along with their open prices from the Polygon API.

I have created the function getNstocks() for this purpose. Inside this function, I called the Polygon Tickers API to get the top 20 stocks, but due to my account's basic plan, I encountered a subscription error. So, I commented out the function and manually inputted the top 20 stock values.
